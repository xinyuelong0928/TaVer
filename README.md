# Lingual-Fusion Adapter-Based Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Code Vulnerability Detection

## Code repository for the study
This replication package contains the dataset and code for our paper `Lingual-Fusion Adapter-Based Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Code Vulnerability Detection`.The work proposes TaVer, an innovative framework that utilizes lingual-fusion adapters and temporal modeling to enhance transfer learning in low-resource code vulnerability detection. Designed to improve accuracy and efficiency in detecting vulnerabilities in languages with limited annotated data, TaVer leverages temporal modeling to capture potential risks as code evolves. This framework equips developers with powerful tools to identify and address security vulnerabilities in their codebases effectively.
